Hello and welcome! I’m a research scientist and data scientist with a passion for computationally driven solutions to complex problems. My background is in physics, where I spent several years working in astrophysics and geophysics research. In recent years, I’ve found a new sense of purpose in medical data science, where I now apply the same core skills---scientific reasoning, programming, and data-driven problem solving---to challenges in healthcare. The opportunity to work with real-world clinical data and contribute to research that can directly benefit patients is something I find both motivating and deeply rewarding.

Since August 2024, I’ve been working at the [University Hospital Zurich](https://www.usz.ch/) as a Data Scientist. My main focus is on the [Save Sight Registries (SSR)](https://savesightregistries.org), a large international database for eye diseases that is considered one of the most comprehensive and clean datasets in ophthalmology. I work on statistical analysis for research publications, write production-ready code for other team members to use, produce visualisations, and collaborate closely with researchers and clinicians to help them get the most from this rich dataset. Before that, I spent six months on a short-term research contract at the [University Hospital Basel](https://www.unispital-basel.ch/en/), where I explored how AI tools, particularly large language models, can be used to understand mental, psychosocial, and psychosomatic stress and illness.

I earned my PhD in Physics with Special Qualification in Astronomy from the [University of Bern, Switzerland](https://www.unibe.ch/index_eng.html) under the supervision of [Dr Martin Jutzi](https://www.space.unibe.ch/about_us/personen/pd_dr_jutzi_martin/index_eng.html#pane1291390). Prior to this, I earned my master's degree in Physics and Astrophysics at the [University of Sheffield, UK](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/) with a year as an exchange student at [Monash University, Australia](https://www.monash.edu/). My academic research has been [published](https://harryballantyne.github.io/publications/) in respected journals such as _Nature Astronomy_, _Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society (MNRAS)_, _Icarus_ and _Geophysical Research Letters_. The research topic during my PhD and subsequent postdoctoral research position is summarised well by the title of my [thesis](https://boristheses.unibe.ch/id/eprint/3879), "Planetary-Scale Impacts and their Geophysical Consequences". In short, that means smashing planets together using smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations and estimating what happens over billion-year timescales. More specifically, I studied impact-related hypotheses for the origin of the crustal dichotomy of Mars and the Sputnik Planitia region of Pluto. During my master's degree, I analysed the results of N-body simulations to explore the stability of planets in binary star systems, under the supervision of [Dr Richard Parker](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/physics/people/academic/richard-parker). Beyond research, I have found great pride in teaching students the wonders of maths and physics. It was through teaching that I discovered my deeper interest in data science and its power across disciplines.

Outside of work, I have always had a great passion for music (particularly of the heavier variety), and enjoy travel, running and the occasional attempt at skiing.
