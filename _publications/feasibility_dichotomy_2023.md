excerpt: "I used smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations to show that the traditional theory of a giant impact in Mars' northern hemisphere forming the 'Martian Dichotomy' is unlikely, suggesting that a more plausible scenario involves an impact and localized magma ocean in the southern hemisphere resulting in a thicker crust in the south, with specific parameters for the impacting object and impact conditions provided."
