title: "Sputnik Planitia as an impactor remnant indicative of an ancient rocky mascon in an oceanless Pluto"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/sputnik_planitia_2024
excerpt: 'I used smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) impact simulations to demonstrate how foreign material from a giant impact can dominate large portions of icy dwarf planets like Pluto, potentially hiding significant reservoirs of dense, rocky material. This research provides new insights into the peculiar shape and location of the Sputnik Planitia region on Pluto, suggesting these features can be explained without a present-day subsurface ocean.'
