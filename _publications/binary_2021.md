title: "Long-term stability of planets in and around binary stars"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/binary_2021
excerpt: 'I analysed the results of N-body simulations to explore the stability of planets in binary star systems and found that the fraction of binary systems capable of hosting stable planets is primarily determined by the stellar binary fraction, with dynamical encounters in star-forming regions having little impact on this stability.'
